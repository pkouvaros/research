Title:

Towards Formal Verification of Neuro-symbolic Multi-agent Systems

Abstract: 

Significant advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled the
automation of challenging tasks, such as computer vision, that have been
traditionally difficult to tackle using classical approaches.  This accelerated
the trend of incorporating AI components in diverse applications with high
societal impact, such as healthcare and transportation. Still, even though
there is an increasing consensus in AI being beneficial for society,  its
inherent fragility hinders its adoption in safety-critical applications.  In
response to these concerns the area of formal verification of AI has grown
rapidly over the past few years to provide methods to automatically verify that
AI systems robustly behave as intended.

This talk will introduce some of the key methods we developed in this area,
covering both symbolic and connectionist systems.  It will discuss logic-based
methods for the verification of unbounded multi-agent systems (i.e., systems
composed of an arbitrary number of homogeneous agents, e.g., robot swarms),
optimisation approaches for establishing the robustness of neural network
models, and methods for analysing properties of neuro-symbolic multi-agent
systems.
